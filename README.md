# Informatics 191 Capstone Project
Course: UCI Senior Capstone Project  
Team: Prestige Worldwide  
Project: Rockwell Collins Venue™ Cabin Management System

## About the Project

This project was created due to the need for remote control software on mobile devices (Android and iOS platforms) for the
Venue™ Cabin Management System. The software needs to be able to control aircraft cabin amenities and serve as an
entertainment terminal so users can watch movies, look at the real time GPS location of the aircraft on a map, and adjust
lighting controls.

We were tasked with adding more functionality to the Venue™ Cabin Management System.
There are four components we chose to implement which include:
* Voice command search functionality
* Mobile media client
* Environment Aware Color Optimization
* Personal photos as icons
